/* I helped with the UI portion but my primary task was ensuring that the server-side was configured correctly and connected to the site whenever a customer placed an order online by filling out the Order Now form.I setup the server-side portion by connecting the Order Now page with a php link and managed using phpmyAdmin. This GUI tool was useful in configuring that the database was setup correctly by ensuring that all tables had matching columns and rows that were also declared within the php file. This php file was important as it held customer's billing information. I also managed to configure the server-side to be connected to the rest of my teams database by exporting and importing it to each one of my member's DBMS. As such everyone would get the information immediately after a customer submitted and clicked on continue to checkout in red at the bottom of the page.*/
