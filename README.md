/* I was tasked with the UI portion and along with handling the database. For the UI portion, we wanted to simplify the interface to make it a seamless experience whenever a customer placed an order and if they wished to leave feedback they could do so as well. There are multiple HTML pages as we wanted to ensure that whenever a user clicked on any of the tabs on the main page, they can easily access the next page and return home just by clicking home. The three tabs are Home, Order Now, and Contact Us. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery were all used in designing the UI/UX part of the site.*/
